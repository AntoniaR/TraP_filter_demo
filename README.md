A Jupyter notebook to access TraP databases and run filtering on the transient and variable candidates.

Demo_Slides_2024.pdf are the slides used when the author was presenting this demo.

TraP_Install_with_Conda.pdf contains instructions for installing and running TraP.

FilterTraP.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook containing all the filtering strategies.
The .py files are all required to be in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook so you need to clone the full repository.
